Exam 1: Check-In Activity
DIRECTIONS:
Welcome to the Science of Learning to Learn - Adaptive Edition. This training program is
designed to teach learning skills that have been studied by educational psychologists and have
been found to benefit learners in university courses and other learning tasks. The training has
been tested and those who complete it have achieved better exam and course grades than
others who spent the same amount of time studying course materials.
The original versions could take as much as 90 minutes to complete the 3-module sequence.
This version of the training is a new design that should shorten that time, depending on the
knowledge of learning skills that you may already possess. For each topic, you will be asked a
few questions to evaluate your understanding of and ability to apply a learning skill. If you
already seem to be familiar with the practice described, you’ll be given a simple reminder
about how to engage in the practice. If you do not seem to know the skill or how to apply it, an
interactive lesson will be provided.
It is strongly recommended that you complete this on a computer because
there are questions that make the layout and responses difficult on a small screen.

Before you begin:
Try this test of your current knowledge about learning!
Question 1: Susan & David
Susan and David have to study a short text passage full of facts for a class exam. Both Susan and David first
spend seven minutes reading the passage. Then, Susan restudies the passage for seven minutes while David
writes down as much as he can remember from the passage but does not study it again. Based on their study
strategies, who do you think will do better on the exam one week later?
Susan
David
Question 2: Why do you think this student's strategy is better?
Not quite. You answered that ${q://QID15/ChoiceGroup/SelectedChoices} will do a better job next week.
Unfortunately, you're incorrect.
Studies show that David’s strategy (self-testing) will produce superior exam performance one week later (and
afterwards) compared to restudying. Interestingly, if the students took the exam immediately after studying, Susan
would score better—restudying produces better immediate results but self-testing produces better long-term
results.
For the best results, after self-testing, go back and study what you missed or could not remember.
Why do people think re-reading is a more powerful learning strategy? Rereading increases your perceived
mastery of the material thanks to its short-term effects. Even though assessing your learning immediately after
studying is much less effective than doing so after some time has elapsed, it’s quite common to do so.

In this case, the students are taking the exam after a delay (one week later). Self-testing produces longer-lasting
results compared to rereading, so it will be a superior strategy in this case. One explanation for this is that actively
retrieving information from memory creates new connections in your brain; these new connections make it easier to
retrieve the information later. In contrast, rereading merely increases your familiarity with superficial features of what
and thus can mislead your judgments of learning. More

1.1. PRE:Self-testing
Let's check the knowledge you already have about self-testing. Please read and respond to the
following question(s):
Self-testing is a useful learning strategy for what reason?
It helps emphasize retrieval practice and bring back information you already know
It helps students remember key information for a longer period of time
It helps with future learning
You answered: "${q://QID211/ChoiceGroup/SelectedChoices}"
This is CORRECT
Self-testing is useful in many ways, but these three choices highlight the most important reasons.
You answered: "${q://QID211/ChoiceGroup/SelectedChoices}"
This is INCORRECT
Self-testing is a learning strategy. It does not help with setting goals. Instead, self-testing helps
emphasize retrieval practice and bring back information you already know, it helps student
remember key information for a longer period of time, and it helps with future learning.
You just began a unit of a course and have 4 weeks of topics to cover before the unit exam. For
each new lesson, the guided reading questions and course outlines make clear that there are a
number of facts, definitions, and properties that you’ll need to be able to recall when the exam
comes.
Pick the best strategy, from those below, that will enable you to rehearse this knowledge and ensure
you can recall it.

After reading each chapter in advance of the day it is covered, reread each chapter repeatedly in
advance of the exam.
After turning in a homework assignment by the deadline, set up reminders in your calendar to re-
complete that homework again at least a few times before the exam.
You answered: "Block out the entire day before the exam. Redo all your homework questions to be
sure you’ve rehearsed fully."
This is INCORRECT
It’s good to redo all these homework before the exam to strengthen your ability to recall the
knowledge. This plan involves retrieval practice on a blocked schedule, which is good, but doesn’t
take advantage of the benefits of spacing out this eﬀort, which further strengthens the eﬀects of the
studying on your recall.
You answered "Block out the entire day before the exam. Reread all the chapters to be sure you’re
on top of all the material."
This is INCORRECT
Spending your final day rereading will require massive eﬀort and, unfortunately, rereading is an
ineﬃcient strategy. Plus, you risk convincing yourself you are more prepared than you really are. It is
better to actively engage in retrieval practice; make sure you are actively asking and answering
questions if you feel unprepared.
You answered "After reading each chapter in advance of the day it is covered, reread each chapter
repeatedly in advance of the exam."
This is INCORRECT
This plan is a good example of spacing, but it doesn’t give you a chance to practice retrieving. That
means your time would be spent less eﬃciently than it would be if you quizzed yourself, and you
wouldn’t be able to know what topics you know well or less well. You should choose to practice test
instead of reread.
You answered "After turning in a homework assignment by the deadline, set up reminders in your
calendar to re-complete that homework again at least a few times before the exam."
This is CORRECT
This plan does the best job of providing many opportunities to practice retrieving the knowledge,

You answered that "${q://QID11/ChoiceGroup/SelectedChoices}" was the learning strategy that is more effective in
improving performance.
Unfortunately, you're a bit off. Contrary to the popular belief, rereading is less effective than repeated self-testing.
The illusion of superiority of rereading tends to result from its better short-term effects (such as when cramming for
an exam). In the long run, however, self-testing tends to be better. For the best results, combine the two
strategies.
You answered that "${q://QID11/ChoiceGroup/SelectedChoices}" was the learning strategy that is more effective in
improving performance.
You are correct! While rereading helps you initially retain more superficial features of a text in the short run (such
as when cramming for an exam), rehearsing the information by repeatedly testing whether you can recall it
produces better long-term performance. For the best results, combine the two strategies.

Let's check the knowledge you already have about spacing. Please read and respond to the
following question(s):
What does the spacing eﬀect show?
It shows that learning is more eﬀective when it is spread out of a period of time versus crammed
before a test
It shows that learning is more eﬀective when you study material once every two months leading up to
a test
It shows that learning is more eﬀective when you should cram before a test versus spacing out the
material over several weeks/months
It shows that learning is more eﬀective when your environment is spacious
You answered "It shows that learning is more eﬀective when you should cram before a test versus
spacing out the material over several weeks/months"

Cramming before an exam tends to be ineﬀective as when you are studying for a final or such, you
have to restudy from the beginning. Cramming helps with short-term knowledge, but not with long-
term knowledge.
You answered "It shows that learning is more eﬀective when your environment is spacious"
This is INCORRECT
The spacing eﬀect has nothing to do with your environment.
You answered "It shows that learning is more eﬀective when you study material once every two
months leading up to a test"
This is INCORRECT
Once every two months is not a consistent enough time-frame for optimal retainment of knowledge.
This is far too spread out.
You answered "It shows that learning is more eﬀective when it is spread out of a period of time
versus crammed before a test"
This is CORRECT
Spreading your learning out over a period of time helps you retain information for a longer period of
time.
Pick the study plan that makes best use of the spacing eﬀect.
After each class period, Ana downloaded the class outline and looked it over, then she looked them
all over right before the exam.
Brad downloaded the course outlines dutifully, and reviewed all that had been released every single
night up until the exam.
Cora set up a schedule where she would review the materials from a lesson that night, then again
three days later, then a week later, then once more right before the exam.
Deneshia downloaded the resources from the course site, and in the week before the exam, she
reviewed them every other day.

This plan does the best job of providing many opportunities to practice retrieving the knowledge,
and it also spaces out the practice. Those gaps between attempts can be used for restudying topics
you struggled on, and can make each retrieval attempt more powerful.
You answered "Brad downloaded the course outlines dutifully, and reviewed all that had been
released every single night up until the exam."
This is INCORRECT
Brad is diligent in his eﬀorts, but his plan to study all the material each night means he probably isn’t
spending enough time on each piece of content to actually learn it, and he’s not giving himself those
gaps that can strengthen his retention when he practices his recall after them.
You answered "Cora set up a schedule where she would review the materials from a lesson that
night, then again three days later, then a week later, then once more right before the exam."
This is CORRECT
Cora does the best job of spacing. She commits initial eﬀort to learning the content, then practices
on a schedule that involves longer and longer delays, which challenge her recall of the material. This
eﬀort and spacing has the best potential make it stick over very long periods of time.
You answered "Deneshia downloaded the resources from the course site, and in the week before the
exam, she reviewed them every other day."
This is INCORRECT
Deneshia is practicing good spacing and may be really investing a lot of time into her review.
However, she left herself only a week worth of time to rehearse a ton of material, which makes it
hard for her to master it all before the day of the exam.

includes a chapter on cellular respiration. The concept involves a few key ideas that aren’t easy to
understand at first, as well as a complex procedure involving many steps that need to also be
understood individually.
A- Read the topic closely, then do it again and again until you think you know it.
B- Transcribe all the details exactly as stated in the textbook into a notebook so you can restudy them
later.
C- Write all you can remember about the concept, then check what you wrote against the description
in the textbook. Highlight the parts where your answer falls apart, then restudy the topic, and give
another shot at explaining it.
D- Practice explaining the concept to another student who is in your class. Ask them to point out
parts of your answer that didn’t sound like the way it was explained in the textbook. Then, look them
up together and discuss what you didn’t get.
E- Rehearse the individual pieces repeatedly, until the larger concept makes sense to you.

Example 1: How does blood move through the circulatory system?
The circulatory system (cardiovascular system) delivers nutrients and oxygen to all cells in the body. It consists of
the heart and the blood vessels running through the entire body. The arteries carry blood away from the heart; the
veins carry it back to the heart. The system of blood vessels resembles a tree: The “trunk”, the main artery (aorta),
branches into large arteries, which split into smaller and smaller vessels. The smallest arteries end in a network of
tiny vessels, the capillary network. There is not only one circulatory system, but two, which are connected: The
systemic circulation provides organs, tissues, and cells with blood so that they get oxygen and other vital
substances. The pulmonary circulation is where the fresh oxygen we breathe in enters the blood. At the same
time, carbon dioxide is released from the blood.

Answer
When I self-test, I practice retrieving information and organizing it in different ways. This
creates new neural connections that make it easier to retrieve the information later, and even
learn more after I self-test. Moreover, since I also attempt to generate an answer during self-
testing (instead of just relying on the broad feeling of knowing based on my familiarity with the
topic), I am more likely to identify gaps in my understanding.
This cycle of self-explanation self-testing, and continued practice until you reach mastery is an important part of
self-regulated learning, which is our next topic.

Let's check the knowledge you already have about self-regulated learning. Please read and respond
to the following question(s):
What is self-regulated learning?
It is when students regulate their peer’s learning and monitor their performance to give them tips of
improvement
It is when students take charge of their learning and monitor their progress throughout the learning
process
It is when students ask their teacher how they learn best and copy that learning strategy
It is when students plan how to learn a lot of information two days before a test

This is INCORRECT
The first stage in self regulated learning is defining a task. Which student eﬀectively completes the
first stage?
Alice consults the course schedule and assigns blocks on her own calendar to complete all the
assigned readings. During those times, she pays close attention to the key vocabulary words
highlighted in the text.
Barry develops a system that he applies when he completes each assigned reading: he color codes
all his material while studying and assigns a color to each concept definition
Cora seeks out the syllabus to review the course objectives her instructor lists, and the assigned
content for the upcoming lessons in the unit. She then reads the learning objectives that precedes the
textbook sections she is to read, and commits them to memory.
Dana considers what she will need to learn in order to succeed in the course and begins by
consulting the learning objectives in the syllabus and those listed at the beginning of each assigned
lesson or reading. She first considers the topic to be covered, then considers the level of
understanding she will need to demonstrate, when tested on it on course exams.
You answered: either "Alice consults the course schedule and assigns blocks on her own calendar
to complete all the assigned readings. During those times, she pays close attention to the key
vocabulary words highlighted in the text." or "Barry develops a system that he applies when he
completes each assigned reading: he color codes all his material while studying and assigns a color
to each concept definition
This is INCORRECT
Alice and Barry both pay attention to the timing and topics assigned in the course, and do a
good job establishing a system for engaging in the assigned coursework. However, neither
considers the instructor’s objectives, which will ultimately determine how much importance is
placed on the topics, and how well one must understand them. Alice’s methods might work
well for improving their knowledge of terms and definitions and Barry’s might help him
understand concepts that span multiple topics if he notices and color codes them accurately,
but neither student is likely to focus on the content that the instructor believes to be most
important, or to learn it at the level of understanding that is expected.
You answered: "Cora seeks out the syllabus to review the course objectives her instructor lists, and
the assigned content for the upcoming lessons in the unit. She then reads the learning objectives
that precedes the textbook sections she is to read, and commits them to memory."
This is INCORRECT
Cora gets oﬀ to a great start by reading her learning objectives, but she needs to go a step

further and analyze which of these learning objectives require her to learn at a factual level
and which require a deeper, more conceptual level, and when she will be expected to apply
the knowledge to real world situations.. It’s not necessary to memorize the objectives, but
looking at the topic and level of understanding is key to defining a task, as is identifying
learning resources that can help develop that understanding.
You answered: "Dana considers what she will need to learn in order to succeed in the course and
begins by consulting the learning objectives in the syllabus and those listed at the beginning of each
assigned lesson or reading. She first considers the topic to be covered, then considers the level of

This is CORRECT
Dana’s approach helped her understand the instructor’s focus and the expectations she will
need to meet on an objective by objective basis. Now she is ready to consider the learning
materials she can use to acquire that knowledge and make a plan for doing so.

Let's further check the knowledge you already have about self-regulated learning. Please read and
respond to the following question(s):
Why are learning objectives important to study?
They are like a study guide where the verb gives you the type of question that the instructor will ask
They should be studied verbatim because the instructor will ask you a question about what the
learning objective said.
They aren’t important to study and you should ignore them.
They help give you a brief overview of the course concepts so you can gauge the diﬃculty of the
course
You answered "They are like a study guide where the verb gives you the type of question that the
instructor will ask"
This is CORRECT
Finding your learning objectives is important to your success in the course. Learning objectives
reveal a lot about concepts instructors want to emphasize.
You answered "They should be studied verbatim because the instructor will ask you a question
about what the learning objective said."
This is INCORRECT
There is no need to go too in-depth with learning objectives and study them verbatim.
You answered "They aren’t important to study and you should ignore them."
This is INCORRECT
Learning objectives are a hidden study guide. You should never underestimate them.

You answered "They help give you a brief overview of the course concepts so you can gauge the
diﬃculty of the course"
This is INCORRECT
Learning objectives can give you a brief overview of the course concepts, but that is not why you
should study them. Instead, you should study them so that you can understand what the instructor
aims to put on their exams.
Ms. Anna gave her students the following learning objective to study: “Identify the characteristics
and basic needs of living organisms and ecosystems.” Based on this learning objective, which
student did the best job interpreting the objective and selecting an appropriate learning strategy to
enact?
Ally finds the information in her textbook and class notes and chooses to rehearse it using retrieval
practice strategies every few days
Barry rereads the textbook with this information in it until he is confident he knows the material
Claire studies the basic definition of living organisms and ecosystems using her textbook and her
notes she took during the lecture.
Dan decides to focus in lecture whenever the keywords in this learning objective are recited.
You answered: "Ally finds the information in her textbook and class notes and chooses to rehearse it
using retrieval practice strategies every few days"
This is CORRECT
We can classify this learning objective as knowledge level which means in order to solidify the
knowledge we just need to find the information in our resources and memorize it.
You answered: "Barry rereads the textbook with this information in it until he is confident he knows
the material"
This is INCORRECT
Rereading it can help passively learn the information, but it is not the most eﬀective strategy.
You answered: "Claire studies the basic definition of living organisms and ecosystems using her
textbook and her notes she took during the lecture."
This is INCORRECT

Studying the basic definition is the first step, but it’s important to read everything the learning
objective is asking for. The objective asks for the characteristics and needs. Just studying the
definition won’t help with understanding this information.
You answered: "Dan decides to focus in lecture whenever the keywords in this learning objective are
recited."
This is INCORRECT
Listening to lecture just for this learning objective will not help you understand other content
that might be relevant to the upcoming test. You should listen to all of lecture to notice what
your instructor decides to emphasize as these are concepts that will likely show up on your
exam.

Which student approaches the following learning objective correctly? “Describe the intricate
relationship between various cellular structures and their corresponding functions.”
Andy finds the word “cellular structure” and “function” in his textbook memorizes/defines these words
Brad creates a relationship diagram to analyze the connections between diﬀerent cellular structures
and their functions
Cory discusses the definition of cellular structures and functions and writes it down to memorize later.
Dani rereads the textbook with this information until it is memorized.
You answered: "${q://QID315/ChoiceGroup/SelectedChoices}"
This is INCORRECT
Andy, Cory, and Dani classify this learning objective as knowledge level based on how they
decide to approach it. This objective is analysis level, thus discussing the
connection/relationship between cellular structures and their corresponding functions is
especially important. Simply memorizing the definitions does not help you with understanding
the objective.
You answered: "Brad creates a relationship diagram to analyze the connections between diﬀerent
cellular structures and their functions"
This is CORRECT
Brad creates a visual representation of the connection between various cellular structures and
their corresponding functions. The objective we are dealing with is analysis level, thus
visualizing and understanding connections is important.

This learning objective requires a relatively high level of understanding, therefore students who
need to study for this type of learning objective cannot limit themselves to memorization. The
prerequisite knowledge for this objective would be to learn what a decision matrix is (its
definition). That could be done by locating the information in the textbook or lecture slides.
Memorization strategies could be applied at this point—for example, students could self-test on
listing features that a decision matrix should have.

help with monitoring your learning
You answered: "Carrie continues to test herself with flashcards repetitively"
This is INCORRECT
Using flashcards for memorization can be a helpful tool but with no sort of “check-in”
involved, Carrie won’t be able to see if flashcards is helping her study the most eﬀectively, and
adapt her ways if not.
You answered: "After Denise completes one self-test, she asks herself if she is retaining the
information with this strategy. "
This is CORRECT
Denise monitors her learning by asking herself if the self-testing she is completing is helping
her learn the information or not. If it isn’t she can choose a new strategy, but if it is, she can
continue utilizing the same strategy.

Elaborate in writing on what it would feel like to achieve the goal.
3. Consider obstacles
Sometimes things do not work out as well as we would have liked. Think about the obstacles that might prevent
you from achieving your goal. What is the most challenging obstacle that stands in your way? What other
obstacles might make it hard for you to achieve your goal? Consider your own thoughts and habits – what
obstacles of your own creation might make it harder to achieve your goal? Spend some time reflecting on these
obstacles.
In the space provided, name the central obstacle. Think about it deeply and imagine the relevant events and
experiences as vividly as possible, then elaborate in writing on what could prevent you from achieving your goal.

Studying multiple subjects at the same time generally leads to suboptimal performances on both
tasks
Multitasking in class can also negatively aﬀect the learning of people around you
Correct! You are not able to pay attention to two things simultaneously, you are switching your attention between
tasks rapidly. During this switch, you are likely to lose some information in your short term memory related to those
tasks. As such, those who try to multitask generally perform worse than those who focus only on studying
