# Additional Database Schema and Code Fixes

After applying our initial fixes, we discovered additional issues that need to be addressed. Here's a summary of the new problems and their solutions:

## New Issues Identified

1. **Function Overloading Conflict**:
   ```
   Could not choose the best candidate function between: 
   public.save_user_data(p_user_id => text...), 
   public.save_user_data(p_user_id => uuid...)
   ```
   
2. **Schema Cache Not Updated**:
   ```
   Could not find the 'metadata' column of 'user_data' in the schema cache
   ```

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Function Name Change**:
   - Created a new function `save_user_data_v2` with clear parameter types
   - Dropped the conflicting versions of `save_user_data`
   - Updated code to call the new function

2. **Schema Cache Refresh**:
   - Added SQL commands to explicitly refresh the PostgREST schema cache
   - Added checks to ensure `metadata` column exists on `user_data` table

3. **More Robust Fallbacks**:
   - Enhanced error handling for database operations
   - Implemented multiple fallback attempts with progressively simpler data
   - Added last-resort fallbacks that store metadata in other fields

## Implementation Steps

1. Created new migration script: `database/migrations/006_schema_cache_fix.sql`
2. Updated code to use new function name in `backend/routes/user_data.py`
3. Added multiple fallback strategies in both `routes/user_data.py` and `utils/db.py`
4. Updated schema fix instructions to include additional steps

## How to Apply These Fixes

1. Run the new SQL migration script to fix function overloading issues
2. Manually refresh the schema cache in Supabase
3. Redeploy the application with the updated code

## Testing Verification

After applying these fixes, you should no longer see:
- Errors about function overloading
- Errors about missing columns in schema cache
- Deployment failures related to database errors

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing an automated database schema check on startup
2. Implement more comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
3. Add a database schema version tracking system
4. Create a unified setup script that applies all needed migrations in order
